Mohd Arafat Hossain's Vim Reference

Start VIM:
Open terminal then
-vim LOCATION_OF_FILE_TO_EDIT

When you start vim it will be in NORMAL mode.
To switch to INSERT mode:
[i]
To switch back to NORMAL mode:
[ESC]
[CTRL+C]
[CTRL+[]

Saving and closing files:
:w (write)
:wq (write and quit)
:q (quit)

Note:
If ever when saving or quiting you get a message saying there is a swap, it means there were previous unsaved changes and saving now would override that old version. You can recover the old changes from the swap if you want [R] or delete the swap [D]. In the location of this file you should see a FILENAME.swp file you can manually delete this file too and it will be the same.

Movement:
[h] - Left
[j] - Down
[k] - Up
[l] - Right
